#. * The #WnckApplication is a group of #WnckWindow that are all in the same
#. * application. It can be used to represent windows by applications, group
#. * windows by applications or to manipulate all windows of a particular
#. * application.
#. *
#. * A #WnckApplication is identified by the group leader of the #WnckWindow
#. * belonging to it, and new #WnckWindow are added to a #WnckApplication if and
#. * only if they have the group leader of the #WnckApplication.
#. *
#. * The #WnckApplication objects are always owned by libwnck and must not be
